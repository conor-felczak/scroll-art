TestingNewStuff prints random still images of either a hat or a mask that scrolls to the right before it resets. 

1. Hat

I was inspired by the calling card from the game persona 5, although it didn't come out quite as expected when it printed in the terminal.

2. Mask

The mask was inspired by the mask from persona 5, again it didn't come out quite right in the terminal (check ConorsAsciiArt.png to see how it looked when I drew it)

I used the 2D array from from Ms. Feng's code, but I used a function to convert 2D char arrays to 1D string arrays in order to finally print it.
